IntergalacticBubbleShootingFish is a 2D Platformer game, build for PC.
We got our inspiration for the game from the super Mario franchise,
specifically the first three games.

This was the first major school projects we made at our study and was the first time both the developers class and the artist class got to work together. We were originally told that we had 3 weeks to finish the project, because of that we spent most of the time on the controls and enemies. When the 3 weeks were done we heard we had an extra 3 weeks. In those 3 weeks we spent more time on the levels. We didn't really work with sprints, rather we decided in the first week what we wanted done in these three week. Of course when we heard we had another 3 weeks to finish the project, we focused on other things. So indirectly we did ended working with sprints.
