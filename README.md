# IntergalacticBubbleShootingFish
We were originally told that we had 3 weeks to finish the project, because of that we spent most of the time on the controls and enemies. When the 3 weeks were done we heard we had an extra 3 weeks. In those 3 weeks we spent more time on the levels. We didn't really work with sprints, rather we decided in the first week what we wanted done in these three week. Of course when we heard we had another 3 weeks to finish the project, we focused on other things. So indirectly we did ended working with sprints.
